# NPN_dataset

The present dataset is build on xxxxxxxx, the result of an empirical analysis that surveys all occurrences of the construction pattern NPN found in CORIS: a large-scale reference corpus of contemporary written Italian developed at the University of Bologna. CORIS (Corpus di Riferimento per l’Italiano Scritto) was designed as a representative corpus of authentic written Italian texts, selected to reflect variety across genres such as press, narrative, academic prose and administrative language, and annotated with part-of-speech and lemma information to support corpus-based linguistic analysis. The corpus is periodically updated through a monitor component, which incorporates new texts to capture ongoing changes in language use.

The differences in frequencies between xxxxxxx and the present dataset are underline in yyyyyyyyy.

For the present dataset, each form was manually searched in CORIS in order to visualize the occurrence within its sentential boundaries. This procedure revealed a number of instances that cannot be identified through a CQL query of the form NN–PREP–NN, since automatic POS tagging occasionally fails to assign the NN tag to nouns that function as such, instead labelling them as verbs (VERB). Main differences in frequency between the present dataset and xxxxxxxxxxx, where they occur, can therefore be attributed to this issue. Other mismatch come from the decision for the present dataset to exclude some occurrences, the main reasons are: duplication of sentences in the corpus, nominal phrase with no significat context. Some occurrenes not present in xxxxx, but istancies of the contruction pattern NPN

The present dataset explores NPN occurrences attested in Monitor CORIS 2020 by collecting and reporting each instance within its specific sentential context.

The label in the dataset can express the following values:
